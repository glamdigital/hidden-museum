    "question": "A fossil is…",
    "correctAnswer": "The remains of a plant or an animal turned to stone ",
    "correctResponse": "Correct! Fossils are produced when a plant or animal dies and is quickly buried under sediment, such as sand, mud or particles in water. Over millions of years, the remains are compressed underground and eventually turn to stone.",
    "incorrectAnswer1": "An ammonite ",
    "incorrectResponse1": "No, an ammonite is an extinct sea creature that lived millions of years ago - the only reason we know about them today is because of fossil remains of their shells.",
    "incorrectAnswer2": "A model of a dinosaur ",
    "incorrectResponse2": "No, a fossil isn't a model, but scientists and museums often use models to help us see and understand ancient creatures."

    "question": "You can find fossilised seashells right here in Oxford. Why do you think this is?",
    "correctAnswer": "Parts of Oxfordshire used to be covered by tropical oceans where sea creatures lived ",
    "correctResponse": "Correct! By studying fossils, we now know that at different times during the Earth’s history Oxford has been part of an enormous undersea coral reef, been covered in swamps, rainforests and tundra and even been buried under miles of ice.",
    "incorrectAnswer1": "Someone brought them back from a trip to the seaside ",
    "incorrectResponse1": "No. The number and variety of shells found buried in Oxfordshire’s rocks tells us that they’ve been here for a very long time – long before humans were around to make trips to the seaside!",
    "incorrectAnswer2": "Some seagulls ate shellfish from the sea and then pooed them out over Oxford",
    "incorrectResponse2": "Nope. The fossilised seashells in Oxford are usually buried deep inside rock where no seagulls could drop them (and seagulls don’t usually swallow the shells anyway!)"

    "question": "What does ‘extinct’ mean?",
    "correctAnswer": "All of these animals have died out ",
    "correctResponse": "Correct! Animals that are alive today are known as ‘extant’, which means ‘existing’. But when scientists can’t find any more living examples of a certain animal, that animal is said to be extinct. Dinosaurs, mammoths and the dodo are all now extinct.",
    "incorrectAnswer1": "This animal never really existed ",
    "incorrectResponse1": "No. You might be thinking of mythical or fairy tale creatures like unicorns or the Gryphon from Alice in Wonderland. The word ‘extinct’ is only used to describe real animals that completely died out, like the dinosaurs.",
    "incorrectAnswer2": "There are very few of these animals or plants left on Earth ",
    "incorrectResponse2": "No. Many animals today are at risk of becoming extinct (dying out completely). They are said to be ‘endangered’. This group includes Asian Elephants, Green Turtles and even the House Sparrow in Britain."

    "question": "Why might scientists choose to study coprolites?",
    "correctAnswer": "They want to know what Icthyosaurs had for their lunch ",
    "correctResponse": "Correct! Coprolites often contain bits of what extinct animals ate. Many Icthyosaur coprolites contain fish scales and bones of smaller Icthyosaurs, which is evidence of what they liked to eat. Scientists who study fossilised poo are called coprologists!",
    "incorrectAnswer1": "They must be very common, so easy to study ",
    "incorrectResponse1": "No, they’re actually really rare. Fossils are usually made from hard bits like bones, teeth and horns. But every now and then, if the conditions are just right, soft things like poo can turn to fossils too.",
    "incorrectAnswer2": "They like gross, smelly things ",
    "incorrectResponse2": "Not exactly. Scientists might often be interested in weird stuff, but coprolites are so old that they have turned to stone (been fossilised), so they are no longer squishy and they stopped being smelly a long time ago."

    "question": "Variation within a species is…",
    "correctAnswer": "When animals of the same type have some small differences between them ",
    "correctResponse": "Correct! Differences between animals of the same species – such as eye colour, fur patterns, fin shapes, height and so on – are called variation within a species.",
    "incorrectAnswer1": "When an animal, such as a tiger, is similar to another animal, such as a cheetah ",
    "incorrectResponse1": "No. Tigers and cheetahs may be similar because they are both big cats, but they are actually completely different species. Variation would be the small differences between two tigers, or between two cheetahs – but not between tigers and cheetahs!",
    "incorrectAnswer2": "When an animal is sometimes tired and weak and might get killed by a predator, but sometimes is feeling strong enough to escape and survive ",
    "incorrectResponse2": "No. Variations are not to do with how an animal is feeling day to day, but to do with the characteristics it has inherited from its parents – things like height, eye colour, fur patterns, fin shapes and so on. But, if it’s lucky, some variations might actually help it to survive!"

    "question": "By ‘natural selection’ Charles Darwin meant… ",
    "correctAnswer": "That animals with characteristics that help them survive will pass on those characteristics to their young ",
    "correctResponse": "Correct! If something about an animal helps it to survive it is more likely to pass its characteristics on to the next generation, so some characteristics naturally carry on and some naturally disappear – natural selection!",
    "incorrectAnswer1": "That animals can choose to change their bodies to suit where they live ",
    "incorrectResponse1": "No. The changes in evolution are not chosen by animals, they happen because some animals survive long enough to pass their characteristics to their young and some don’t.",
    "incorrectAnswer2": "Breeding animals like pigeons or dogs so that they look how you want them to ",
    "incorrectResponse2": "No. Although breeding animals to keep certain characteristics – such as speckled wings in pigeons – is a kind of selection it is not a natural process. In fact, Darwin called this ‘artificial selection’."

    "question": "Which of the animals on this table is adapted to live in water?",
    "correctAnswer": "Turtle ",
    "correctResponse": "Correct! You can see the creature’s legs with paddles on the end – perfectly adapted for swimming in water. Their land-based cousins, the tortoises, have flat feet and legs which support their bodies upright on land.",
    "incorrectAnswer1": "Swift",
    "incorrectResponse1": "No. Swifts are perfectly adapted to life in the air. In fact, they hardly ever even settle on land – they even sleep while flying! Once they leave the nest as a young bird, swifts don’t land again until they return to have their own chicks.)",
    "incorrectAnswer2": "Allosaurus",
    "incorrectResponse2": "No. Allosaurus was a large carnivorous dinosaur that lived around 150 million years ago. Dinosaurs were reptiles which lived on the land. But there were many sorts of reptiles which lived in the sea at the time of the dinosaurs. We call them marine reptiles."

    "question": "What features does Archaeopteryx have that modern birds DON’T?",
    "correctAnswer": "Teeth",
    "correctResponse": "Correct. Teeth are heavy, so they would weigh birds down when they fly. Instead, modern birds have brilliantly adapted beaks to suit what they eat – long and thin to fish worms out of mud; short and stout for cracking nuts… the list goes on. Some birds do have jagged points on their beaks, but not proper teeth like Archaeopteryx had. ",
    "incorrectAnswer1": "Feathers",
    "incorrectResponse1": "No. Archaeopteryx, and many dinosaurs, had feathers. We now think that even T. rex had fluffy down (which might have made them a little less terrifying!) and others like the Microraptor used feathers to glide, but Archaeopteryx is one of the earliest to use feathers to fly.",
    "incorrectAnswer2": "Claws",
    "incorrectResponse2": "No. Archaeopteryx had claws on its feet that look like dinosaurs’ feet, but modern birds’ feet look like this too. Have a look at the Shoebill nearby! It does have odd ‘finger’ claws, which most birds have lost, but the Hoatzin from South America still has this feature."
