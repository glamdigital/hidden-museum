Rather than leaving the wide rim blank it has been decorated with silver-inlaid pictorial representations of the signs of the zodiac, alternating with warrior figures.\n<br><br>\nThe combination of astronomical mechanism and elaborate ornament indicates that this was an extremely important commission. The inscription running round the circumference of the back plate proclaims the instrument's significance and profundity: \n<br><br>\n'This is an astrolabic disc, which can show you: a crescent moon, which progressively waxes and then returns to its waning phase; the celestial bodies of the sun and moon, when they are in opposition or in conjunction; and the points on their paths in a given year or month or at this moment. This disc is the product of the endeavour of someone learned in the technical arts, which are based on precision and scientific proof. Behold the disc! It will show you many of the wonders that prove the wisdom of the Merciful; its different motions are by virtue of a single mover, and it has meanings going beyond all meanings.'\",",

Einstein's visit to give the Rhodes Lectures, and also to receive an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Oxford University on 23 May 1931, was hosted by the physicist Frederick Lindemann.[4] Einstein's first lecture was on relativity, the second on cosmological theory, and the third one was on unified field theory.\n\nThe board itself was rescued by E. J. Bowen at the end of the lecture and donated by the Warden of Rhodes House, Sir Francis James Wylie.[5][6] The blackboard included equations concerning the diameter, expansion, and age of the universe. \"L.J.\" on the blackboard indicates \"light years\" in German. However, the results were never published by Einstein subsequently.\n\nThe blackboard is considered a \"mutant\" object or artefact in that it is very different from most of the objects in the collection of the museum (mainly scientific instruments such as astrolabes).[7][8]\n\nEinstein returned to Oxford to lecture again in 1933.[9]",
