In his\n                    lecture Einstein outlined a fairly simple model to explain this apparent expansion. In the first line on the\n                    blackboard, D, the measure of expansion in the universe, is defined in terms of the expansion factor P. The\n                    expression for the density of matter in the universe, given by ρ in the third line, is derived from the field\n                    equations.

The paper centred on the draft of a letter\n                    sent by Sir Constantijn Huygens to Robert Hooke in 1673, which I found in the Royal Archives at The Hague in\n                    2002.

Motivated by problems in ecology, I had been studying some first-order difference equations\n                    that entomologists and fisheries people had suggested as rough caricatures of the dynamics of certain\n                    populations.  Earlier work had focussed on identifying constant, equilibrium solutions (“nature’s balance”) and\n                    left it at that.  I elucidated the “cascades of period doubling” (and coined this term) as the “boom and bust”\n                    of the nonlinear difference equation became more pronounced with increasing population growth rate, λ; as λ\n                    increases, the equilibrium solutions for X change from constant to up-down cycles with successive periods\n                    2, 4, 8, 16, … .   But I could make no sense of what happened next, beyond the “point of accumulation” of\n                    these cycles at λ = 14.77… .   Later, in collaboration with Jim Yorke (Maryland), George Oster (Berkeley)\n                    and others, I came to understand that beyond lay 1-dimensional “chaos”.  This was one of the two strands that\n                    brought chaos centre stage in the mid-1970’s, the other strand being Lorenz’s work on 3-dimensional systems\n                    of differential equations, where what is going on is inherently harder to understand.
